              Why I Founded Tucker Trips
            </h2>
            <div className="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                I started Tucker Trips after becoming increasingly frustrated with the endless—and often fruitless—search for <strong className="text-[#3a4d6f]">trustworthy travel reviews</strong>. While planning family vacations, I found myself drowning in anonymous opinions from strangers on big travel sites, never knowing if the glowing 5-star review was genuine or just another paid promotion.
              </p>
              <p>
                As someone who genuinely loves exploring new places with my loved ones, I realized what I actually needed wasn't more reviews—it was <strong className="text-[#3a4d6f]">better reviews from people I trust</strong>. I wanted to hear from my friends who'd actually been there, my family members who know my travel style, and my network of fellow adventurers whose judgment I value.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's when the idea for Tucker Trips was born—<strong className="text-[#ec4899]">a private travel community where real people share real experiences</strong>. No fake reviews. No hidden agendas. Just authentic trip logs, honest recommendations, and reliable advice from your trusted circle. With the right information at hand from people you know, you can focus on creating memories instead of second-guessing every booking.
